# AML-FLC

## Overview

AML-FLC is a comprehensive MATLAB implementation of an **Enhanced Fuzzy Logic Optimized Controller (FLC)** for an intelligent assistive care environment, designed for disabled residents. It features multi-modal sensor integration, advanced Mamdani fuzzy inference systems, actuator control, and genetic algorithm optimization. This project was developed for the STW7085CEM Advanced Machine Learning course assignment.

## Features

- **Complete FLC Design**: Covers temperature, lighting, audio/alert, and humidity controllers.
- **Assistive Environment Simulation**: Models a smart, accessible flat for disabled residents.
- **Multi-modal Sensors**: Simulates temperature, light, humidity, motion, and time-of-day sensors.
- **Mamdani FIS Models**: Intuitive rule bases for interpretability and safety in assistive care.
- **Accessibility-Focused Actuation**: Heating, cooling, lighting, humidity, and adaptive audio systems.
- **Comprehensive Rule Bases**: Safety and comfort prioritized; emergency overrides included.
- **Visualization**: Plots control surfaces, membership functions, and scenario outputs.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Trains and tunes FIS parameters for optimal performance.
- **Test Scenarios**: Realistic cases for validation, including emergency and various impairments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (Recommended: R2021b or later)
- Fuzzy Logic Toolbox

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/acesur/AML-FLC.git
   cd AML-FLC
   ```

2. Run the main controller script:
   ```matlab
   AML.m
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Display environment and system configuration.
   - Build all FIS controllers with custom rules.
   - Simulate realistic assistive care scenarios.
   - Visualize system outputs and membership functions.
   - Save FIS systems for GA optimization.

### Optimization

- The script generates a training dataset and sets up genetic algorithm parameters for further FIS tuning.
- You can modify GA settings in the `AML.m` script for experimentation.

## File Structure

- `AML.m` — Main MATLAB implementation (controller logic, FIS design, testing, visualization).
- `assistive_care_fis_systems.mat` — Saved FIS objects for GA optimization (generated by script).
- `README.md` — This documentation.

## Scenarios Covered

- Morning wake-up (wheelchair user)
- Afternoon activity (visual impairment)
- Evening rest (hearing impairment)
- Night sleep mode
- Emergency scenario
- Hot day cooling

## Visualization

- System performance bar charts
- Membership function plots for all FIS
- Control surface visualizations
- Chromosome parameter bars (GA)
